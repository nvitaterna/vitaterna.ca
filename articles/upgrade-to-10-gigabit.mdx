## Introduction

I'm going to acknowledge the fact that I do not need this upgrade. At the time of writing this article, my desktop is the only device on my network with faster than 1 Gigabit - which is still only 2.5 Gigabit. But my ISP offered 3 Gigabit for only $5 more than my current 1.5 Gigabit plan. So why 10 Gigabit? Cost. After researching 2.5 gigabit equipment, I found that 10 Gigabit was often the same price or cheaper. So I decided to go for it.

## Hardware

### ISP Modem

I'm going to start with the ISP-provided modem/router combo. Unfortunately, it is impossible to completely bypass it, but with PPPoE you can get a public IP address on your router. My ISP is Bell, and they provide a Gigahub - a newer version of their Home Hub 4000. It has one 10 gigabit ethernet port and 4 gigabit ports. I will be using the 10 gigabit port to connect to my router.

For the sake of this article, I will refer to this modem/router combo as the "modem."

### Router

Before upgrading my network, I used a Lenovo ThinkCentre M73 SFF with an i5-4570. Plenty fast for gigabit, though PPPoE does have some overhead. Unfortunately, I didn't test the 3 Gigabit connection with it before the change, but I was confident it would have no issue with it.

I ended up purchasing a used Thinkcentre Tiny M720q with an 8600T. I've already got one of these with an 8700T running Proxmox and the rest of my home lab - so the platform was familiar, and I knew I could add a network card to it. The intention of the upgrade was to future-proof while also improving power usage and form factor. The typical TDP is going from 84W to 35W, and I'm getting 2 more cores. The size is also much smaller, which is excellent for my small-ish living area - from 12 litres down to 1 litre.

### Network Card

I went with a cheap ConnectX-3 Pro SFP+ card from eBay. At CAD ~30, shipping from China was the cheapest option for anything faster than 1 gigabit. It took about a month to arrive, but it was worth waiting for. Since it's SFP+ - I knew I'd need an RJ45 transceiver to connect it to the Gigahub.

### Switch

I debated going for a used switch, but the only affordable options I could find were the large rack-mounted switches. I opted to go for the [Mikrotik CSS610-8G-2S+IN](https://mikrotik.com/product/css610_8g_2s_in). After some quick research, this was the cheapest option with my required features. I was able to source this from a local seller for about CAD ~200 all in. It's a managed 10 gigabit switch with 8 Gigabit ports and 2 SFP+ ports.

### Transceivers

Finally, I'd need some transceivers to connect everything. I needed two ethernet transceivers and one DAC cable. Thanks to [Serve the Home's article on SFP+ to 10Gbase-T Adapters](https://www.servethehome.com/sfp-to-10gbase-t-adapter-module-buyers-guide/), Plenty of these 10 gigabit transceivers are actuylly multi-gigabit. I initially purchased two 10Gtek ASF-10G-T. As well as one of their DAC cables. Everything worked great except for the 2.5G connection to my desktop - I was not getting the entire throughput. Upon researching, I stumbled upon one of [Jeff Geerling's articles](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2021/ethernet-was-slower-only-one-direction-on-one-device) regarding these multi-gig ethernet transceivers.

I kept one of the 10GTek transceivers for the connection between my modem and router, as that was having no issues. Still, I went with a Wiitek SFP-10G-T to connect to my desktop and got around 2 Gigabit download and 2.5 Gigabit upload. Not quite all the way there, but close enough for my use case.

## Software

This section will be light as the only software needed was OPNsense. SwOS is included with the CSS-610 switch.

### OPNsense

I initially used pfSense on the M73 but switched to OPNsense because they are basically the same. I like to go open source when I can, especially when there's no friction in changing. Considering that I was already going to be re-doing my configuration, there was no reason to stick with pfSense.

I downloaded the DVD image from the [OPNsense download page](https://opnsense.org/download/) and put it on my USB drive that is running [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html), then booted from it. The setup was simple. Anyone familiar with pfSense would have no issue setting up OPNsense. While I couldn't test the full 10 Gigabit through WAN, I could pull the full 3 Gigabit on [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/) using their CLI.

There was one thing I did have to configure in OPNsense to get the SFP card to work. I had to set `mlx4en_load` to `yes` in `SYSTEM:SETTINGS:TUNABLES` to load it at boot. Other than that, everything worked out of the box.

All of that just for a bigger number! I'm happy with the upgrade, and learned a few things in the process.
